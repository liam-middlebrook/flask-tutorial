## About

I'm a second year student in the Game Development program at 
Rochester Institute of Technology. I am able to wear many hats in software
development and have listed some of my favorites below:

  * Graphics Programmer

  * Open Source Developer

  * Python Hacker

I release a lot of my projects under open source licenses, most of them can
be found on my GitHub page: [@liam-middlebrook](https://github.com/liam-middlebrook)
